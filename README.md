# Spring WebSocket

Simple web application that implements messaging using the new WebSocket capabilities introduced with Spring Framework.

WebSockets is a bidirectional, full-duplex, persistent connection between a web browser and a server. Once a WebSocket connection is established, the connection stays open until the client or server decides to close this connection.

A typical use case could be when an app involves multiple users communicating with each other, such as in a chat. We will build a simple chat client in our example.
